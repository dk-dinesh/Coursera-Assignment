                <h2>Apple</h2>
                <p>
                  An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree
                  (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and
                   are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The
                   tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
                    Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been
                    grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were
                    brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have
                     religious and mythological significance in many cultures,
                     including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.

                <h2>Mango</h2>
                <p>
                  Mangoes are juicy stone fruit (drupe) from numerous species of
                  tropical trees belonging to the flowering
                  plant genus Mangifera, cultivated mostly for their edible fruit.
The majority of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes.
 The genus belongs to the cashew family Anacardiaceae. Mangoes are
  native to South Asia,from where the "common mango" or "Indian mango",
   Mangifera indica, has been distributed worldwide to become one of the
   most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics. Other Mangifera species
 (e.g. horse mango, Mangifera foetida) are grown on a more localized basis

                <h2>Banana</h2>
                <p>
                    A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.
